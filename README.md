# Graph Coloring App

A simple Python application for graph coloring using the Tkinter, NetworkX, and Matplotlib. This application allows users to input a graph by specifying nodes, edges, and available colors. It then performs a graph coloring algorithm to color the nodes in such a way that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.
