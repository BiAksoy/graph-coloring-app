# Graph Coloring App

This is a Python application that allows you to interactively color graphs using the tkinter and networkx libraries. The app lets you define nodes, edges, and available colors, and then visually displays the graph with colors assigned to nodes while ensuring no adjacent nodes have the same color.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
